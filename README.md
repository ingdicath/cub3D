# cub3D

***CODAM project Curriculum 2019/2020 - My first RayCaster with miniLibX***

This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90â€™s game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. The goal was to
make a dynamic view inside a maze.

This project contained mandatory part and some bonuses.

```
$ ./cub3D ./<file name path with a valid map>

```
$ ./cub3D ./<file name of your choise with a valid map> --save
```
