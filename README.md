# cub3D

CODAM project Curriculum 2019/2020 - My first RayCaster with miniLibX

This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90â€™s game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. The goal was to
make a dynamic view inside a maze.

This project contained mandatory part and some bonuses.

### Bonuses implemented:
- Wall collisions.
- Ability to look up and down (Up arrow key, Down arrow key)
- Floor & ceiling texture.
- Object collisions.
- Rotate the point of view with the mouse (It works for rotate right & left, look up & down)
- Jump or crouch (Space key for jump, Left Shift key for crouch)
